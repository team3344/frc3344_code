# install git: http://git-scm.com/download
# create an account on GitHub.com - it's free
# ask to be added as a collaborator - send an email to justbuchanan@gmail.com

# most of this setup is done through the command line
# windows: "Git Bash"
# mac: "Terminal.app"

# create an ssh key:
ssh-keygen -t rya -C "myemail@example.com"	# hit yes/enter until it finishes generating the key


# copy the key to the clipboard:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

# add the ssh key on GitHub (it's under "Account Settings -> SSH Public Keys")
# name it whatever you want & paste the key contents in there (it's already in the clipboard)


# cd to the directory where you want your copy of the repository to go
# if you don't know what "cd" is, just type "cd ~/desktop" to put it on your desktop


# clone the repository:
git clone git@github.com:team3344/frc3344_code.git


# You're done!
# if you had problems, send them to justbuchanan@gmail.com for help - screenshots of the problem help!
